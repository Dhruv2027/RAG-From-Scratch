# RAG-From-Scratch

This Jupyter notebook contains my attempt to create a RAG pipeline from scratch, without using LangChain's in built text-splitting and chunking packages. This project was more to deepen my understanding of what goes behind the scenes while creating a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, than to create a product of high quality. Here, I used the Sorcerer's Stone as my dataset to create a RAG pipeline. Upon creating this pipeline, I learnt about how LLMs use the token context length and how I can optimize each LLM's performance based on the prompt I give and the length of tokens I provide as context to the LLM. \

I asked various niche questions like "Which vault was the Sorcerer's Stone kept in Gringotts Bank?" and "When was Harry's first Quidditch match?" I was pleasantly surprised to find out that my system, although rudimentary, was able to provide an accurate response to my queries.
